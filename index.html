      <h4>My first Task</h4>
      <p>Here's a small JS code I found on the internet to display today's date: <span id="date-time"></span>. </p>
      <p>Took me a while to remember how to properly include JS into HTML, but basically you have to put the script tag after the body tag, and not in the head tag, like how I did with the css styling. Here I used the JS Data object to display the current date and time. By defualt, it uses your borwser's current date and time. So i'm assuming if you're not from the Midwest, your time will be different from mines. </p>
      <p>Todo: how do I create a blog like website where only I can post, but you can comment? Because right now, I'm just hard coding all my thoughts into VSCODE. I would probably need... </p>
      <ul>
        <li>database of some sort?</li>
        <li>some kind of authentication</li>
        <li>an editing box</li>
        <li>button where I can post to the database?</li>
        <li>some way to edit what I posted</li>
        <li>oh, I guess it's like some kind of API POST, PATCH...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's probably a little bit diffcult I suppose.</p>
