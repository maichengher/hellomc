# hellomc
Instead of helloworld, it's hellomc. This is a blog to self learn and teach myself how to code again. I did a bootcamp called i.c.stars in 2019, and after the intership I am employed as a Test Engineer. I need to refresh my memory and become a well rounded technologist. I am still learning so please all I ask is for advice on my code and be patient with me. Thanks for lurking. :)
